docker compose down
Description	Stop and remove containers, networks
Usage	docker compose down [OPTIONS] [SERVICES]
Description
Stops containers and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by up.

By default, the only things removed are:

Containers for services defined in the Compose file.
Networks defined in the networks section of the Compose file.
The default network, if one is used.
Networks and volumes defined as external are never removed.

Anonymous volumes are not removed by default. However, as they don’t have a stable name, they are not automatically mounted by a subsequent up. For data that needs to persist between updates, use explicit paths as bind mounts or named volumes.

Options
Option	Default	Description
--remove-orphans		Remove containers for services not defined in the Compose file
--rmi		Remove images used by services. "local" remove only images that don't have a custom tag ("local"|"all")
-t, --timeout		Specify a shutdown timeout in seconds
-v, --volumes		Remove named volumes declared in the "volumes" section of the Compose file and anonymous volumes attached to containers
